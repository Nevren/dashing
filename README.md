# Dashing
Stylish framework for web apps

## Getting Started

### Working with SASS

#### 1. Include Normalize

Include normalize first in your main application Sass file. We provide a version of normalize that we keep updated, or you may include normalize directly.

```scss
@import "/bower_components/dashing/sass/vendor/normalize";
```

> Note: You could optionally use the normalize project directly

#### 2. Include Base

Base files include variables, mixins, extendables, utilities and the dashing color scale.

```scss
@import "/bower_components/dashing/sass/base/base";
```

#### 3. Optional â€“ Include an overrides file to customize the default variables

```scss
@import "overrides";
```
> Note: This is a custom file that you will need to create and include from your styles directory.

#### 4. Include Modules

```scss
@import "/bower_components/dashing/sass/modules/modules";
```


### Working with CSS

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/bower_components/dashing/dashing.css">
```

## Development

### Clone the repository with git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dashframework/dashing.git
```

### Releasing a new version

1. Build the Sass and compress the CSS

```bash
sass --watch dashing.scss:dashing.css --style compressed
```

2. Check the previously tagged versions

```bash
git tag
```

3. Update the version number in the `bower.json` file (See [here](http://keepachangelog.com/) for versioning conventions)

4. Commit the changes made in the previous steps

```bash
git commit -m "[message]"
```

5. Tag the commit with the appropriate version number

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
```

6. Push your committed changes

```bash
git push
```

7. Push your new tag

```bash
git push --tags
```
