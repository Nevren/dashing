# Dashing
Stylish framework for web apps

## Getting Started

### Working with SASS

#### 1. Include Normalize

Include normalize first in your main application Sass file. We provide a version of normalize that we keep updated, or you may include normalize directly.

```scss
@import "/bower_components/dashing/sass/vendor/normalize";
```

> Note: You could optionally use the normalize project directly

#### 2. Include Base

Base files include variables, mixins, extendables, utilities and the dashing color scale.

```scss
@import "/bower_components/dashing/sass/base/base";
```

#### 3. Optional â€“ Include an overrides file to customize the default variables

```scss
@import "overrides";
```
> Note: This is a custom file that you will need to create and include from your styles directory.

#### 4. Include Modules

```scss
@import "/bower_components/dashing/sass/modules/modules";
```


### Working with CSS

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/bower_components/dashing/dashing.css">
```
