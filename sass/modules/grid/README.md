# Grid
View an example of Dashing Grid.

> **Tip:** We apply border-box to every element so the border and padding of an element is included in the width of the columns.

## Grid
Being able to seamlessly translate your App between multiple devices is a must. User experience can be greatly damaged if your App doesnâ€™t translate to the device of their choice. Using a responsive grid fixes that problem, allowing your content to easily translate to any device.
